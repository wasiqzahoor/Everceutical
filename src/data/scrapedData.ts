      "Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles (30–150 nm) secreted by nearly all cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). They function as biological delivery vehicles — carrying proteins, lipids, mRNA, and microRNA between cells to regulate tissue repair, immune response, and regeneration. In aesthetic medicine, exosomes act as potent signaling molecules that rejuvenate aging skin, stimulate collagen production, reduce inflammation, and accelerate wound healing at the cellular level.",
